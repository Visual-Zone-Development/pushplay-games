description: Make an online multiplayer game in games/ feel good despite network delay, using the kit's net.js (the host runs the game) — instant local feedback, smoothing, generous and fair hit rules, what belongs in net.state versus net.event, private views for secrets, bandwidth limits, joins and leaves mid-match, and testing with two copies. Use for "online feels laggy", "hits don't register", "players teleport", "too much bandwidth", "add online play", or any change to an --online game's networking.

# Online netcode

Follow AGENTS.md (*Online multiplayer*) and **read [multiplayer.md](../../../docs/game-design/multiplayer.md) first**: it has the full `net.js` API. Never edit `net.js` or `lobby.js`. The model is fixed: every copy calls `net.setInput(...)`; only the host runs the rules in `hostUpdate(dt)`, reading `net.inputs[id]` and writing `net.state`; every copy draws `net.view`.

## 1. Find what feels bad
Run `npm run dev <id>` and play in **two browser windows** (the dev relay starts automatically); also play as the non-host, which is where lag shows. Note: is it **input delay** (my action shows late), **jitter** (others jump around), **unfair hits** (I got hit when I'd dodged), or **bandwidth** (the check warns above about 20 KB/s for two players)? `window.__kitNet` shows status, players and bytes sent.

## 2. Fixes by symptom
| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| My own action feels late | **Instant local feedback**: play the sound, flash, muzzle effect or a small predicted motion on button press on the local copy, before the host confirms. Keep the authoritative result from `net.view` |
| My character feels sluggish | Lower-latency mechanics: shorter wind-ups are hidden by local animation; movement that accelerates (rather than snapping) hides delay |
| Others jump or stutter | Keep positions and angles **fractional** (they're blended between updates); keep counters whole; don't recompute wobbling floats |
| Teleporting on respawn / big moves | Send a `net.event('teleport', { id })` so copies snap instead of gliding across the map |
| Hits feel unfair | Generous hitboxes, slower projectiles, telegraphed attacks; judge hits on the host only; show hit results with a clear effect |
| Too much data | Only what players must see goes in `net.state`; particles, shake and sounds come from `net.event` on each copy; key collections by id (`bullets: { b17: {...} }`), never arrays that shift; no per-frame timers in state (send an end time once) |
| Secrets visible in dev tools | Hidden info goes in `net.privateView(id)` → `net.mine`, never in `net.state` |
| Someone leaves mid-match | Handle `net.on('leave')`: remove or freeze their character, keep the match going if the rules allow; `end` (host left) returns everyone to the lobby with the reason |
| Late joiner sees nothing | Everything they need to draw must be in `net.state` (they get it all once on join); don't rely on events they missed |

## 3. Design for the delay
About 80 ms plus network delay sits between the host and other players. Good fits: co-op, party, racing, brawlers with chunky hits, sports, turn-based and card games. Avoid frame-perfect timing; when a mechanic needs precision, make it **host-friendly for everyone** (wider windows, slower bullets, aim assist).

## 4. Flow rules that must keep working
- `title` → `lobby` → `playing` ↔ `paused` with `state.screen` and `window.__game` exposed.
- `menu` opens the `menu.js` pause menu (Resume, Settings, Leave game); it only stops your own controls (`net.setInput({})`), the host keeps running.
- Show who's who: "You", colours by `net.slot(id)`.

## 5. Verify
1. Two windows by hand, as host and as guest; then with one window throttled (DevTools → Network → slow 4G) to feel delay.
2. `npm run check <id>` plays two copies together through a local relay; fix every ✗ and the bandwidth warning.
3. **Bump `version`** whenever the netcode or state shape changes: only builds with the same version play together.
4. Update DESIGN.md (Changelog), commit (`<Name>: netcode …`) and push.
