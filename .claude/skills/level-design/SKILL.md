name: level-design
description: Design and build the content of a game in games/ — hand-made levels, enemy waves, procedural or seeded generation, difficulty curves, pacing and boss or finale moments — so the game keeps introducing something new and ramps fairly. Use for "add more levels", "it gets boring after a minute", "too easy / too hard later on", "make a level editor format", "add procedural maps", or the content part of a new game. For tuning a single number use improve-game; for feel use game-feel.

# Level design

Follow AGENTS.md. Read the game's `DESIGN.md` (fun targets, session and structure, core loop) and the code that spawns or loads content.

## 1. Map the curve before building
Write a short **pacing table** in DESIGN.md under *Scope* (or a new *Content* section): one row per level, wave or minute of play.

| # / time | New thing introduced | Threat level (1–10) | Breather? |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 / 0:00 | core verb only, impossible to fail | 1 | |
| 2 / 0:30 | first hazard, telegraphed | 2 | |
| … | | | |

Rules of thumb ([complete-game.md](../../../docs/game-design/complete-game.md), [genres.md](../../../docs/game-design/genres.md)):
- **Something new every 30–60 s** of play: an enemy type, a hazard, a mechanic, a music layer, a visual change.
- **Teach, test, twist:** introduce a thing safely, then test it, then combine it with something already known.
- **Saw-tooth difficulty:** ramp, peak, breather, higher ramp. Never a flat line, never a cliff.
- **Early wins:** the first minute is nearly impossible to lose.
- **An ending or a moment:** a boss, a finale wave, or a milestone (every 5 waves) with a bigger reward.
- **Handheld readability:** the whole threat fits the 1280×800 view, or is telegraphed before it enters it.

## 2. Pick the content format
- **Hand-made levels:** data, not code. Tile strings (`'#..^..G'`) or small arrays in a `levels.js` module next to `game.js`, one entry per level with its name and parameters. Easy to add, easy to read in a diff.
- **Waves:** a list of `{ at, spawn, count, pattern }` entries, or a budget system (each wave gets `budget = base + growth × n` points to spend on enemies with costs).
- **Procedural:** a seeded RNG (e.g. mulberry32) so `?seed=123` replays the same run ([debugging.md](../../../docs/game-design/debugging.md)). Generate from hand-made **chunks** stitched together, not pure noise, and validate each result (reachable exit, no unavoidable damage) and regenerate if it fails.
- **Daily seed** (stretch): seed from the date so everyone's run is the same that day; save the day's best.

All difficulty knobs (spawn rates, speeds, budgets, growth) go in `TUNING`. A difficulty setting multiplies them; add it as an `extra` item in `settings.js` if the kickoff asked for selectable difficulty.

## 3. Build and verify the curve
1. Build the content in the format above, level by level or wave by wave.
2. Add `window.__game.jumpTo(n)` (see the debug overlay convention) so any level or wave can be reached instantly.
3. Use a repro script to capture screenshots at each level or at 10 s, 60 s, 3 min, and read them: is each stage visibly different? Is anything unreadable or overcrowded?
4. If a bot or replay is practical, run the `playtest` skill to measure where runs end.
5. Progress saves via `save.js` (unlocked levels, best per level); saved on every level clear and on pause.
6. `npm run check <id>`, fix every ✗.
7. Bump `version` (minor for new content), update DESIGN.md (pacing table, Changelog), commit (`<Name>: levels …`) and push.
8. Tell the user where the new content starts and what to watch for ("does wave 6 feel like a spike?").
