# Definition of done

What separates a complete game from a toy. Copy the items that apply into the game's `DESIGN.md` under **Definition of done**, tailored to the game, and tick them off before calling it finished. `improve-game` audits against this list too. Missing items here are usually the biggest, cheapest wins.

## Play

- [ ] **Onboarding by doing.** The first 30 seconds teach the core verb through play, using in-world prompts (`Press ${input.label('a')} to jump`) that disappear once used. No walls of text, no separate tutorial screen required.
- [ ] **Clear goal.** The player always knows what they're trying to do. One objective on screen.
- [ ] **An ending or a score to beat.** Either a win state (levels, a boss, a finale) or an endless mode with a score or time that's saved as a personal best.
- [ ] **Difficulty curve.** Early wins in the first minute, then a steady ramp. Something new (enemy type, hazard, mechanic, music layer) appears roughly every 30–60 seconds of play. No sudden spikes.
- [ ] **Fair failure.** Threats are telegraphed and readable at handheld size. When the player loses, it's clear why.
- [ ] **Retry hook.** After game over, play again in **one press**, in under a second. Show the score, the best, "new best!", and near-miss feedback ("2 away from your best").
- [ ] **Progression or variety.** At least one of: levels, unlocks, upgrades between runs, random runs (procedural layouts or seeds), a collection.

## Feel

- [ ] **Every action has feedback**, both visual and audio: movement, hits, pickups, damage, menu moves.
- [ ] **Juice aimed at the fun targets.** Hit-stop, screen shake, particles (capped, e.g. ≤ 300 alive), squash/stretch, easing. The biggest effects go on the biggest moments.
- [ ] **Rumble** on big impacts where `gamepad.vibrationActuator` exists (guard for `null`).

## Audio

- [ ] **SFX for every action**, generated with `audio.tone()` / `audio.noise()` or bundled files via `audio.load()` + `audio.play()`.
- [ ] **Music**: a simple generated loop or a bundled track that fits the mood, on the `music` bus.
- [ ] **Audio unlock**: `audio.js` starts the context on the first input and mutes on pause; nothing in the game assumes sound is running before the first key, click, tap or button press (browsers outside the launcher block it).

## Screens and flow

- [ ] **Title screen** with the name, a start prompt built from `input.label('a')` (it reads "Tap" on touch), a pause hint from `input.label('menu')`, and the best score. If gameplay needs a controller or keyboard, the title says so.
- [ ] **Pause** on `menu` (Start, Esc, P, and the on-screen pause button for mouse and touch), with exactly **Resume, Restart, Settings, Quit to title** (inside the launcher, `menu.js` adds **Quit to library** last). The game is fully frozen while paused.
- [ ] **Auto-pause** via `input.onPause` (launcher overlay, lost focus, hidden tab, all controllers gone) lands on the pause screen and saves.
- [ ] **No exit of its own**: nothing bound to F10, Start+Select or a held Esc, and no "exit to launcher" item: the pause menu's Quit to library comes from `menu.js` (see *Leaving your game* in AGENTS.md). A pause menu not built with `menu.js` adds it itself, only when `window.pushplay?.quit` exists.
- [ ] **Every menu works with every input**: controller, keyboard, mouse and touch, via `menu.js` (move, choose, back, hover, click, tap; left/right for values). `b` is back, `menu` pauses; they are never swapped.
- [ ] **Game over / results** screen that's satisfying to look at (tally animation, stats), with retry in one press.
- [ ] **Settings** from `settings.js`, reachable from title and pause: master / music / SFX volume, reduced shake / flash, text size, plus difficulty or other game items as `extra`. Saved under `<id>-settings-v1`.
- [ ] **Saves** via `save.js` under `<id>-save-v1`: best score, unlocks and (for longer games) progress. Saved on every change that matters, on pause, and in `input.onPause`; versioned with `migrate` when the shape changes.
- [ ] **Cursor** hidden only during gameplay in mouse mode, visible in every menu.
- [ ] **`state.screen`** is one of `title | playing | paused | settings | gameover` and `window.__game = { state, TUNING }` is exposed.

## Accessibility

- [ ] **Colorblind-safe**: don't rely on hue alone. Pair color with shape, icon or pattern.
- [ ] **No required button mashing** or long holds without an alternative.
- [ ] **Reduced shake / flash** honoured: when `settings.data.reducedShake` is on, no screen shake, white flashes or strobing.
- [ ] **Text ≥ 24px** at 1280×800, high contrast, scaled by `settings.data.textScale`.
- [ ] **Prompts never hard-coded**: every button name comes from `input.label`, `input.stickLabel`, `input.dpadLabel` or `drawPrompts`, and switches when the player changes device.

## Scaling and inputs

- [ ] **`fitCanvas`** handles the window: letterbox in the game's colour, DPR capped at 2, `integer: true` for pixel art. Looks right at 1280×800 (Deck), 1920×1200 / 2560×1600 at DPR 2 (Legion Go), 1920×1080 and small resizable windows.
- [ ] **Manifest** has `tags` and `inputs`; `inputs` lists only what gameplay really supports (menus support all four regardless).
- [ ] **Verification matrix** done by hand: controller, keyboard only, mouse only, touch (DevTools device mode), 1920×1080 at DPR 2 (see AGENTS.md).
- [ ] **Local multiplayer** (if any) joins by press per controller through `input.pads[i]`.

## Under the hood

- [ ] **`TUNING` object** at the top of `game.js` holds every gameplay number (speeds, timings, spawn rates, ramp). Later changes are then one-line edits.
- [ ] **Delta-time movement**, clamped (`dt = Math.min(1/20, …)`), so it plays the same at 60, 90 or 120 Hz.
- [ ] **Debug overlay** behind `?debug` (see [`debugging.md`](debugging.md)).
- [ ] **Runtime files unedited** (`input.js`, `menu.js`, `fit.js`, `audio.js`, `save.js`, `settings.js`, `prompts.js` keep their header); game keys added with `input.extendKeys`.
- [ ] **Steady 60fps** on the Deck and Legion Go, DPR 2 included: no per-frame allocations in hot loops, capped particles.
- [ ] **Nothing shipped but the game**: no `tools/`, `mockups/`, `*.py`, `__pycache__/` in the folder.
- [ ] `npm run check` passes (gamepad, keyboard-only, touch, Start → `paused`, 1920×1080 at DPR 2) and the screenshot shows real gameplay or a real title screen.
