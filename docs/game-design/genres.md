# Genre loop templates

Starting points for games that suit a handheld played on the couch. Each one lists:
- the loop
- the fun it naturally delivers
- a controller mapping
- a v1 you can build in one sitting
- stretch features that add the most

A great small game is often a **familiar genre + one twist + a theme**: "a Breakout where the ball is a cat", "a racing game where you build the track while driving".

### Puzzle
*Tetris, Baba Is You, Threes, Sokoban.*
- **Loop:** read the board → plan → act → see the consequence (aha!) → next puzzle or rising pressure.
- **Fun:** Challenge (mental), Discovery, Submission (for endless falling-block styles).
- **Controls:** d-pad moves the cursor or piece, A acts, B undoes (always offer undo in level-based puzzles), Y restarts the level.
- **v1:** one core rule, 15–20 hand-made levels that each teach one idea (introduce, develop, twist), undo, level select with completion saved.
- **Stretch:** a second rule that combines with the first, par or star ratings, an endless mode.

### Racing
*Mario Kart, Trackmania, F-Zero.*

- **Stretch:** AI rivals with rubber-banding, items, 2-player shared-screen versus, track unlocks.

### Rhythm
*Rhythm Heaven, Crypt of the NecroDancer, Beat Saber.*

- **Stretch:** decorations, seasons, a collection book, gentle goals.

### Party / local multiplayer

- **Loop:** short round (30s–3min) → chaotic interaction → winner or score → quick results → next round or minigame.
- **Fun:** Fellowship, Sensation, Challenge.
- **Controls:** one stick + A (+ B) per player. Keep it simple enough that a guest learns it in 10 seconds.
- **v1:** 2–4 players on one screen, a join screen ("press A to join" per controller), one arena mode, round wins to 3.
- **Stretch:** several modes or arenas, handicaps, solo practice vs. simple bots.

## Scoping rule of thumb
- **v1 = one sitting.** The core loop, the full definition of done ([complete-game.md](complete-game.md)) and enough content for about 10 minutes of fun.
- **Stretch goes in DESIGN.md**, and `improve-game` picks it up later.
- If a v1 needs more than about 3 distinct systems (e.g. movement + combat + inventory + crafting + dialogue), cut until it doesn't.
